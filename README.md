# 📘 30 Days of Python – Habiba Isah

Welcome to my 30-day Python learning sprint, inspired by the [Teclado Python Challenge](https://teclado.com/30-days-of-python/) and structured as part of the ArewaDS fellowship.

This repo documents my daily Python practice Python exercises from the ArewaDS Python Programming Fellowship.

Each folder in this repository is organized by topic and contains exercises relevant to its name. For example, the folder 04_Exercise_Strings includes exercises specifically related to working with strings.

Feel free to explore and learn with me as I work through these exercises
